Github is an insanely powerful tool that can be used to help more easily navigate and share code. I won't lie I am still very intimidated by it but I look forward to continuing to learn how to use it.


9/23: HTML Structure Elements Upadted:


HTML is a very visual code, things that were helpful include the setup for adding hyperlinks:
#<,a href="https://www.example.com">Click here to visit Example.com</a>
images: #<,img src="image.jpg" alt="Alternative text">
and that in order to create sections you must include the command at the beggining and then a backslashed version of the command at the end.
